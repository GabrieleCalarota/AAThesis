	Authorship attribution (AA) is the process of identifying the author of a given
	text and from the machine learning perspective, it can be seen as a classification
	problem. In the literature, there are a lot of classification methods for which feature
	extraction techniques are conducted. In this thesis, we explore information retrieval
	techniques such as Doc2Vec and other useful feature selection and
	extraction techniques for a given text with different classifiers.
	The main purpose of this work is to lay the foundations of feature extraction
	techniques in AA. These are lexical, character-level, syntactic, semantic, application
	specific features.
	We also improved, to the best of our knowledge, the results on the Reuters Corpus dataset both in the 10-authors group and in the 50-authors group.
