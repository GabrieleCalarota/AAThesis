	In this work we evaluate domain-specific embedding models induced from textual resources in the medical domain. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a standard, broadly used classification system, that codes a large number of specific diseases, symptoms, injuries and medical procedures into numerical classes. Assigning a code to a clinical case means classifying that case into one or more particular discrete class, hence allowing further statistics studies and automated calculations. The possibility to have a discrete code instead of a text in natural language is intuitively a great advantage for data processing systems. The use of such classification is becoming increasingly important for, but not limited to, economic and policy-making purposes. Experiments show that domain-specific word embeddings, instead of a general one, improves classifiers in terms of frequency similarities between words.
