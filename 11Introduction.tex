\subsection{Motivation and Problem Statement}


\subsection{Thesis Structure}
The rest of this thesis is organized into the following chapters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Chapter 2}. Chapter 2 provides a word embedding background, the main topic on which this thesis is based. We will discuss some of the most popular methods among numerical word embeddings and words representation. Then we will explain some of the most recent related work on word embeddings and ICD-9-CM classification.
	\item \textbf{Chapter 3}. Chapter 3 presents the datasets; we divided them in our domain-specific dataset, from where each part of it was taken from and how to reproduce it. At the end of the chapter we present also the general purpose dataset used as a comparison for our less popular domain-specific word embedding.
	\item \textbf{Chapter 4}. Chapter 4 provides the results obtained by showing most similar words in our evaluated models. It shows also characteristics of our models and dataset, with most frequently words, medical jargon, typo errors and comparison between domain-specific models and general domain one. At the end of the chapter we present the results of the F1 calculated by a classifier that used a general purpose word embedding and another one that used our domain-specific word embeddings.
