\chapter{Our approach}


In order to test and compare our approach, we reproduce the testing scenario
described in the previous research \cite{stamatatos2013robustness} using the Guardian corpus. The experimental
scenario is as follows: (1) select at most ten samples per author in each topic category
(in Fig. 2 the distribution of the samples per author and per category after considering
the restriction of ten samples per author is shown), (2) use the samples in the Politics category as training set and train the classifier, and (3) finally, test the classifier using
another topic category different from Politics (four possible pairings).
