Authorship attribution is the process of identifying the author of a given text and from
the machine learning perspective, it can be seen as a classification problem. In the
literature, there are a lot of classification methods for which feature extraction techniques
are conducted. In this thesis, we explore information retrieval techniques such as Doc2Vec
and other useful feature selection and extraction techniques for a given text with different
classifiers. The main purpose of this work is to lay the foundations of feature extraction
techniques in authorship attribution. At the end of this work, we show how we compared
our results with related works and how we managed to improve, to the best of our
knowledge, the results on a particular dataset, very known in this field.
